    <h3>
      zidane:Zidane started his career at Cannes, before establishing himself as
      one of the best players in the French Ligue 1 at Bordeaux. In 1996, he
      moved to Italian team Juventus, where he won several trophies, including
      two Serie A titles. He moved to Real Madrid for a world record fee at the
      time of €77.5 million in 2001, which remained unmatched for the next eight
      years. In Spain, Zidane won several trophies, including a La Liga title
      and the UEFA Champions League. In the 2002 Champions League final, he
      scored a left-foot volleyed winner that is considered one of the greatest
      goals in the competition's history.

    <h4>
      ancelotti: On 25 June 2013, Ancelotti became the manager of Real Madrid,
      replacing the departing José Mourinho, and signing a three-year
      contract.[111][112] He was introduced at a press conference at the
      Santiago Bernabéu, where it was also announced that Zinedine Zidane and
      Paul Clement would be his assistant coaches. Shortly following his
      arrival, Real Madrid confirmed the signing of Isco for a fee of €24
      million, which was followed by the signing of Asier Illarramendi for €32
      million.
